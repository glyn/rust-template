# Repository Title

Brief description.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome. Please ensure they conform to the conventions described below.

### Conventions

The `.editorconfig` file captures basic source files formatting conventions.
Many editors support this file natively; others (such as VS code) require a plugin, see https://editorconfig.org/.

The default branch is `main`. See [Renaming the default branch from master](https://github.com/github/renaming) for the rationale.

Commit logs should describe the specific changes made by a commit. See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
